\description{
Functions to create and update Twitter Bootstrap Alerts in shiny
}
\details{


Alerts are used to convey small amounts of information to the
user of your shiny app. They have default stylings to convey the type of
information they contain. For example, you may want a warning alert that
lets your user know that they have made an invalid selection, or a success
alert that lets them know some process has completed successfully.

Use \code{bsAlert} within ui.R to mark where in the app you want
your alerts to appear. You can add multiple \code{bsAlert} anchors to an app
if you want alerts to appear in different places.

\code{createAlert} is used in server.R to create an alert within
an anchor created by \code{bsAlert}. For example, you may have an observer
that watches for certain conditions, like a missing input or an empty
data.frame and calls \code{createAlert} to create an alert warning the user
of the problem.

The alert consists of an optional \code{title} and \code{message}. The title
will appear on its own line as larger bold text. The message is the main
body of the alert and with dislay as standard text.

\code{closeAlert} is used from server.R to close an existing alert. You must have assigned the alert an alertId at creation to use \code{closeAlert}.

Run \code{bsDemo()} for a live example of shinyBS Alerts functionality.

\section{Options}{


\code{alertId} is optional but serves two useful functions. First, if an
alert is assigned an id with \code{alertId} it can be dismissed later by
using \code{closeAlert}. Second, if you assign an alert an id, shinyBS will
check to see if an alert with the same id already exists, and if it does it
wont create the new alert.

\code{type} is used to set the style of the alert. There are currently four
options: \code{warning}, \code{danger}, \code{info}, or \code{success}.
These Correspond to standard Twitter Boostrap styles.

The Twitter Bootstrap documentation says that \code{block} is for use when
\code{message} is longer. It adds a small amount of additional padding to the
alert that is meant to help set it apart from other elements on the page. I
don't see that it makes much of a difference...

By default, any alert created with \code{createAlert} will have a small "x"
button in its upper-righ corner that the user can use to dismiss the alert.
You can remove this button by setting \code{dismiss = FALSE}. If you do
this, you may want to set a value for alertId so that you can remove the
alert with \code{closeAlert} later.

By default, when you use \code{createAlert} it will create an append an
alert below the last alert created in the anchor. If \code{append = FALSE}
then any existing alerts in the anchor will be removed before the new alert
is created.
